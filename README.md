VOYAGER PROJECT
===============
This is a Travel project based on Google Map API key. 
(Note: the site can't be running with expired key)

The challenge was to learn working with:
* Prototyping, making schema of the project, finding needed components and frameworks;
* React-hooks like useEffect using different API requests and its dependencies; 
* Managing "props" parent-children and children-children, which caused a lot of difficulties due to the complexity of the idea of the project for ambitious beginner  developers;
* Deploy correct routing with react-routing-dom

The project needs to be finished but the main idea was accomplished.

*******************
I used some components from MDB https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/react/components/demo/

And I use Material design <npm install @material-ui/core>
